## Getting Started

Getting started with a discord bot can be a little confusing sometimes. So, Ive made Mr.Penguino's setup quite a _breeze_ with 4 easy steps:

- Step 1) Invite Mr,Penguino to your server by clicking [This Message Right Here!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1369067763540164669&permissions=1651414934534&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)

- Step 2) Setup for FIRST log channel by using `/setlog`(Trust me you will want to do this)

- Step 3) Thats it! Thats all that is needed to make sure that Mr.Penguino functions just as it should!
