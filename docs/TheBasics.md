# Basic Commands

## Introduction: Getting started using commands

If you are new to using discord bots as a whole and want to be introduced to how they work, this is also a great bot for you too!

Mr.Penguino's very first commands that was ever made for him was specifically designed to be as user-friendly as possible.

However, since I'll be giving a rundown of every command works, I figured to include these to introduce anyone new to discord bots who want to learn the sheer power, automation AND usefulness of discord bots like Mr.Penguino.

## Action Commands

### /timeout

The timeout command has been used through discord all throughout its eventual development and is a KEY tool in moderation to make sure that if users need a little break from the server, it doesn't need to be through a temporary ban.

In this command, there are two options that need to be filled out:

- User; Who you want to time out.

- Time; how many minutes you want the user to be timed out for.

These two options allow the bot to recognise who to time out and for how long so that if someone needs some time away from your server, you can set this up ^^

_*If you don't know what timing out a user actually is, please do visit this website to read up on how it works and what it is by [Clicking Here!](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191-Time-Out-FAQ)*_

### /ban

This command again has two options. However, it's command is a little more harsh than a timeout command as it PERMENANTLY removes and locks a User out of your server.

This command comes with 2 options:

- User; Who will be banned

- Reason; What the ban reason will be 

These two options help the bot know who to ban and what to set the ban reason to so that if someonee wants to know why the user is banned, the admin or mod can simply read the reason that the ban comes with!

### /tempban

The successor to the /ban command. However, the command is able to ban someone for a specific amount of time. This sort of command is mainly more useful for users who have done something not too deplorable but who don't deserve the /timeout command. A great middle-ground punishment!

The options for this command are:

- User; Who to tempban

- Days; This is how long they could be banned (in days)

Now, I _did_ have the opportunity to make another option to choose different measurements of time. However, I feel like it would make using the command ALOT more easier for most users if there is just one measurement rather than 3 or 4.

## Log Commands

### /setlog

This command is where the bot REALLY shines! If you was to do any command that has been mentioned above and if you use this command, any command used above after will be conveniently logged as an embed!

However, don't fret. This command is nowhere as complicated as it sounds.

The command options for this command are:

- Channel; This tells the bot where to send the log messages

What? Was you expecting more? This command REALLY is just that easy! Oh and also, if the bot leaves your server and the bot rejoins some other time later (and if you haven't deleted that channel yet), the bot will STILL LOG to that channel.
