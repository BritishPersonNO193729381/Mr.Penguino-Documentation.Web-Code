# Discord Bot Commands:

## Introduction

Bot commands are a very useful way for users to interact with Mr.Penguino and offer alot of useful features to the user that are quite configurable so that your servers protection stays unique.

Each command has its own options that sometimes requires different fields to be filled. For example, some commannds might requre you to insert a username to ban someone, a channel to set a log channel OR even a .json file to mass assign roles. However, there is no need to worry!

Ive made sure that every command that I have made has enough clarity for most users to know how to use them. However in this documentation, there will be a multitude of pages dedicated to showing off each catagory of commands ranging from beginner commands to commands that are used for more larger and professional servers.

## Where do I start?

Well, if there is a command you REALLY want to learn how to use, go ahead and skib a few of the entries since I admire your enthusiasm ^^

However, if you want to understand the full extent of Mr.Penguino, Id advise you skim through each document in accending order for the best experience :D

Also as a reminder, if you are stuck at any time with a command or are just confused in general, please do visit our support server as we can help you use Mr.Penguino to its MAX potential!
