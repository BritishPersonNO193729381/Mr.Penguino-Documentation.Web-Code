For example, some commannds might requre you to insert a username to ban someone, a channel to set a log channel OR even a .json file to mass assign roles. However, there is no need to worry!</p> <p>Ive made sure that every command that I have made has enough clarity for most users to know how to use them.

However, the command is able to ban someone for a specific amount of time. This sort of command is mainly more useful for users who have done something not too deplorable but who don't deserve the /timeout command. A great middle-ground punishment!</p> <p>The options for this command are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>User; Who to tempban</p> </li> <li> <p>Days; This is how long they could be banned (in days)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, I did have the opportunity to make another option to choose different measurements of time. However, I feel like it would make using the command ALOT more easier for most users if there is just one measurement rather than 3 or 4.</p>"},{"location":"TheBasics/#log-commands","title":"Log Commands","text":""},{"location":"TheBasics/#setlog","title":"/setlog","text":"<p>This command is where the bot REALLY shines! If you was to do any command that has been mentioned above and if you use this command, any command used above after will be conveniently logged as an embed!</p> <p>However, don't fret. This command is nowhere as complicated as it sounds.</p> <p>The command options for this command are:</p> <ul> <li>Channel; This tells the bot where to send the log messages</li> </ul> <p>What? Was you expecting more? This command REALLY is just that easy! Oh and also, if the bot leaves your server and the bot rejoins some other time later (and if you haven't deleted that channel yet), the bot will STILL LOG to that channel.</p>"}]}
